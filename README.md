D. Telemetry<br />
Answer: A</p>

<p>3. Layer 2 switching is one of the most common Ethernet technologies. Which of the following statements is false about Layer 2 switching principles?<br />
A. Layer 2 switch maintains a MAC address-to-interface mapping table-known as the MAC address table - by parsing and learning source MAC addresses of Ethernet frames. When receiving an Ethernet frame, the switch searches its MAC address table for the outbound interface based on the destination MAC address of the frame.<br />
B. If the destination MAC address of a received data frame is not a broadcast address, the switch searches the MAC address table for a matching entry based on the destination MAC address of the frame. If a matching entry is found, the switch forwards the frame to the corresponding interface. If no matching entry is found, the switch discards the frame.<br />
C. Layer 2 switch works at the second layer (data link layer) of the OSI model and forwards data packets based on MAC addresses.<br />
D. If the destination MAC address of a received frame is a broadcast address, the switch forwards the frame to all interfaces (except the inbound interface of the frame) in the same VLAN.<br />
Answer: B</p>

<p>14. Which of the following are typical application scenarios of the stacking technology?<br />
A. Improved reliability: Member switches in a stack work in redundancy mode.<br />
B. Increased number of ports: If the port density of the original switch cannot meet the access requirements of users, you can add new switches to set up a stack with the original one to increase the number of ports.<br />
C. Increased bandwidth: When higher uplink bandwidth is required, you can add new switches to set up a stack with the original one, and bundle physical links of the member switches into a link aggregation group to increase the uplink bandwidth.<br />
D. Simplified networking: Multiple devices set up a stack and are virtualized into a single logical device. The simplified networking does not require loop prevention protocols, such as MSTP, making network configuration much simpler. In addition, the use of inter-device link aggregation achieves fast convergence upon the failure of a single device, improving reliability.<br />
Answer: ABCD</p>
